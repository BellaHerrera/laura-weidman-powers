<h1>Laura Weidman Powers</h6>
</center>
<p>Laura Weidman Powers is a partner at Base10 Partners, the former CEO of the technology industry diversity organization Code2040 and formerly worked at White House Office of Science and Technology Policy during the Barack Obama administration. With a Black mother and a white father and surrounded by the diversity of her city and her school, she grew to appreciate the value of diversity at an early age. She told an interviewer in 2016, "You see everything in New York. You see wealth. You see poverty. You see the best and the worst of society. You see people from all backgrounds. You hear every language being spoken on a daily basis. It's just such a multicultural upbringing, that I think it really shaped my view of what the world can or should look like.</p>
